          Migrate package to Dist::Zilla

          Changed my mail address to jawnsy@cpan.org

          Fixed POD

          Update MANIFEST.SKIP according to new defaults provided by
          ExtUtils::Manifest

          Remove pass-through Build.PL

1.001     2009-08-17

          Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article:
          http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/

          No longer use Perl::Critic to test

          Resequenced test files

1.0.2     2009-06-15

          Fix description

          Overhaul test scripts, remove author tests from Recommends
          (Alias' journal #5375)

          No longer test Perl::Critic during AUTOMATED_TESTING, only
          RELEASE_TESTING. Thanks to Elliot Shank for the discussion
          in a private mail.

          Require Internet (HAS_INTERNET) to do the signature test,
          since it tries to download the key from a keyserver

          Removed a file carried over from Test::DistManifest, which
          I copied the base structure from (CIRCULAR.SKIP) and updated
          MANIFEST accordingly

1.0.1     2009-06-15

          Add test coverage information

          Fix Test::DistManifest test script so that it doesn't depend
          on it

          Updated perlcriticrc

1.0       2009-06-14
