=head1 NAME

Env::Sanctify::Auto - Perl module that cleans up %ENV

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0.2 ($Id$)

=cut

use version; our $VERSION = qv('1.0.2');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Environment variables such as B<PATH> (command search path) and B<IFS> (input
field separator) can have severe security ramifications. Luckily, enabling
Perl's taint mode will provide some extra checking whenever there can be
potentially unsafe calls to functions like B<system> or B<open>.

However, there has been no simple way to load a module which automatically
cleans up your environment. Various methods are used to temporarily clean up
the environment for you or forked children, such as:

  local $ENV{PATH} = '/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin';

While this works for most purposes, it has some potential issues such as what
to do when the paths are different under different architectures. Obviously
such a command is not portable to environments with different path conventions
so this would break your program's compatibility with Win32, among others.

This simple module subclasses B<Env::Sanctify> to take care of this for you.
Among other things, this means you get the nice bonus of lexically scoped
environments (see L<Env::Sanctify> for details).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $env = Env::Sanctify::Auto->new();
  # do some stuff, fork some processes, etc.
  $env->restore; # everything is back to normal.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However, because
it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be compatible
with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite modules.

It is untested on Win32 and unlikely to work for the time being.

If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please
contact the maintainer.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

This module knows about the following environment variables:

=head2 PATH

B<PATH> provides a list of paths to search for executables, which influences
which commands are invoked by unqualified calls to system() and others. This
variable is particularly dangerous because even if you use a fully qualified
call to the executable, like "/usr/bin/echo ..." -- there is still a security
hole, since B<echo> could be executing unqualified code itself.

The safest way to handle this, and the strategy used by this module, is to
remove everything except C</usr/bin> and C</usr/local/bin> (or equivalent,
depending on your operating system).

=head2 CDPATH

B<CDPATH> provides additional paths for B<cd> to search on the system when it
is called. This is dangerous because you could be attempting to change into
a known safe directory, but the CDPATH may divert you to another directory.
The variable is generally of limited usefulness, and so is removed completely
during C<%ENV> scrubbing.

=head2 IFS

B<IFS> is the Internal Field Separator, which tells the operating system
what characters should be considered whitespace separating command line
arguments. Combined with controlling B<PATH>, this exposes a very dangerous
vulnerability: if the IFS is set to '/', then C<system('/bin/more')> is
essentially the same as C<system('bin more')>. As a result, the 'bin' command
is executed instead of '/bin/more' as expected.

=head2 ENV and BASH_ENV

B<ENV> and B<BASH_ENV> list files that are executed whenever a new shell is
started, which includes whenever a shell script (.sh) is run.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Env::Sanctify::Auto->new($opts)

=head2 Env::Sanctify::Auto->sanctify($opts)

Creates a new C<Env::Sanctify::Auto> object, scrubbing the environment to
remove or pacify potentially dangerous variables. Options may be passed as
a hash reference to the constructor.

Code example:

  my $env = Env::Sanctify::Auto->new;

By default, PATH will be set to a sane value, but you can override the
behaviour by passing the 'path' option:

  my $env = Env::Sanctify::Auto->new({
    path => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin'
  });

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, $opts) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this as a class method') if ref($class);

  Carp::croak('Options must be given as a hash reference')
    if (defined $opts && ref($opts) ne 'HASH');

  my $path;
  if ($opts->{path}) {
    $path = $opts->{path};
  }
  else {
    $path = _secure_path();
  }

  # Construct the Env::Sanctify (superclass) base
  my $self = Env::Sanctify->sanctify(
    env => {
      PATH => $path,
    },
    sanctify => [
      'CDPATH', # cd search path
      'IFS', # Internal field separator
      'ENV',
      'BASH_ENV',
    ]
  );

  # Re-bless this into our package
  return bless($self, $class);
}
*sanctify = *new;

# Private utility functions
sub _secure_path {
  # Return a PATH specific to the platform we're running on
  if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
    return '%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem';
  }

  # Assume everything else is Unix-like
  return '/usr/bin:/usr/bin/local';
}

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 KNOWN BUGS

There are no known bugs as of this release.

=head2 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item *

There are lots of variables that can do dangerous things, particularly when
executing files via C<system()> or others. This module tries to fix the most
common ones, but is by no means a complete way to sanctify your namespace,
and is not a substitute for performing your own security audit.

=item *

I'm not a security expert, so more than likely I've missed something.
Please do file bug reports so that I can fix the module.

=item *

I don't have access to a VMS machine, nor do I know how they work, so there
is currently nothing here to deal with that. If you have a OpenVMS machine
or know how they work, feel free to send me an e-mail or patch.
